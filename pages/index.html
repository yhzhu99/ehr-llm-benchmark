                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>The rapidly expanding deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine necessitates a clearer understanding of their efficacy in conventional non-generative clinical prediction tasks, where their performance relative to established methods has been uncertain. This study comprehensively benchmarks 9 GPT-based LLMs, 5 BERT-based models, and 7 conventional clinical prediction methods across supervised predictions using structured Electronic Health Records (EHR) and unstructured clinical notes. Our findings significantly revise previous assumptions: for clinical note-based predictions, state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek R1/V3, GPT o3-mini-high) in zero-shot settings now considerably outperform fine-tuned BERT-based models. With structured EHR data, while specialized conventional models achieve superior performance when fully trained with ample data, leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek R1/V3) demonstrate strong zero-shot capabilities, often surpassing conventional models trained on limited datasets, with a narrowing performance gap. Notably, open-source LLMs are competitive or even superior to proprietary LLMs. These results indicate modern LLMs are increasingly potent for non-generative clinical tasks, excelling with unstructured text and offering data-efficient solutions for structured data, thus warranting a nuanced model selection strategy.</p>
